### Notebooks


```FlowAtBreaklinesDev```: Notebook walking through development process for extracting data and recreating flow hydrograph creation at breaklines.

```GetBreaklineDataDev```: Notebook walking through development process for extracting data from ```.hdf``` files to get required mesh data by flow hydrograph creation at breaklines.

### Scripts

Preliminary tools for automating the workflows developed in notebooks.


```ras_mesh.py```: Retrieves mesh data from ```.hdf``` plan file.
```get_bline_flows.py```: calls ras_mesh and retrieves hydographs at breaklines.
